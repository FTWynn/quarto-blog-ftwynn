## Description

OpenTelemetry has greatly impacted the observability landscape over the past few years. While it introduces an open standard for telemetry generation and collection, what is actually improving the lives of o11y teams?

Join us for an in-depth chat with guests David Wynn, Austin Parker, Vijay Samuel, Noƒçnica Mellifera, and Iris Dyrmishi on the idea of how we can evolve existing observability practices into something even better than what we have now.

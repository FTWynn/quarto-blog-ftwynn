Wondering what is this? [Read the explainer from Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about).
:::

Currently I'm at the phase of life where time is short, professional opportunities are large, and my family demands every ounce of attention I can give them.

I've been thinking a lot about how I want the day to day of the next few decades of my life to go across a range of different areas. That's led to active experimentation around new professional skills, new fitness routines, seeing friends more often, reading more books, fewer video games (sadly), more intentional consumption of art (starting with comics), and integrating more philosophy into my routine.

Most recently I'm starting a new role at a new startup. I'm looking forward to the adventure.

I'd journaled about it in my monthly review over and over. I'd re-enforced the ideas around what is truly important and what I truly control over and over again.\n\nNow if I'm being honest, I hadn't fully committed emotionally in those thought experiments. After all, Google had never done a layoff, and I knew from first-hand experience how hard it was to fire individuals. But even then, there was emotional muscle memory there.\n\nAnd I felt... much calmer than I expected. More importantly, I could explain why. \n\nMany of my friends in the same boat got angry for a number of reasons, whether transparency or fairness or abruptness or impersonal-ness... but I found myself focusing back on the things I could control in fairly short order. \n\nIf \"the obstacle **is** the way,\" then there were opportunities to be found even here. I remembered that this situation is pretty similar to how Zeno started his journey in creating Stoicism. This has all happened before, if not specifically to me.\n\nThe [words of the Seneca](https://dokumen.pub/nero-emperor-of-rome.html) kept running through my head from when he was ordered to death.

Especially by building habits. Especially by journaling. Especially by taking to heart the parts that resonate with you. \n\nIf you do that, then you'll find just like I did, when life takes a negative turn for you, your practice will be there for you. Your routine will be there for you. It will be as solid as you make it, and you can lean on it for support.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nI find that Stoicism is a great philosophy for times of crisis. \n\nIf you're under pressure, dealing with a lot of expectations from a lot of people, or generally just having a rough go of things, I find the tenets and practices of Stoicism to be empowering, practical, and very useful in moving your life to a better place.\n\nThat said, many adopt Stoicism in good times, including me.

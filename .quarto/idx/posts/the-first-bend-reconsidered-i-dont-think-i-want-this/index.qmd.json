Plus, for my goal (to follow people around at DragonCon and play the themes of any costumes I see), I'll mostly (if not only) be playing melodies anyway.\n\n## The Chromatic Harp Seems Closer to My Goals\n\nWith the walk around DragonCon as my goal from the very start, I thought this would be achievable enough on the diatonic. It has enough range, and with the right technique and practice I could pull all the notes out that I needed. Most learning material these days seems to be for diatonic, so there's plenty of help out there. I might have to transpose a few songs into a different key, but no big deal.\n\nHowever, as I've gotten into it I've learned that diatonic harmonicas tend to be more blues and band focused. This is a pretty far mark outside of what I want to do, and it feels a bit like I'm trying to pit a round peg in a square hole. \n\nChromatic's focus on melodies and including accidentals in the design means I carry fewer harps, focus on the stuff that will make people smile, and hopefully won't rely on bends... or at least not as much as on diatonic.\n\n## A Chance to Go Lower\n\nThird, the least impactful factor but not a totally insignificant one, I've found that I love playing lower notes on the harmonica. The 12 and 16 hole chromatics give the full range on those deeper notes without crazy bending work. I'm sure there will be other challenges making the switch, but even just switching the key from a diatonic C harp to a diatonic A harp made practicing much more enjoyable for me. I look forward to even more octave flexibility as I walk down this road.\n\n## Moving Forward\n\nThe biggest challenge I think I'll have moving forward is figuring out what new lesson plan I should undertake. Some of the original checklists for beginner intermediate and advanced look like they still apply, but I'll want a lesson plan more focused on chromatics. I'll post here with what I come up with once I've found it.\n\nHopefully I'm not re-reviewing my harmonica journey too soon, but I think these are probably appropriate adjustments to make 4 weeks in, and I'm trying to be open to the idea that changing course is not the same as failure or abandonment.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nSo, I know I'm in danger with this current line of thinking, because changing course just as you start learning something can lead to a lot of errant twists without making any progress.

I don't think they've even started to grasp the shape of the cage they're in. \n\nThis has heightened the suspense so much more than normal, even in typical scenes.\n\nFor example, when Ruby and Jet, subbing in for Lapin, head on the clandestine mission with Senator Ciabatta to infiltrate a _fake_ priest's home who has already arrested and from Ciabatta's kingdom... I was holding my breath the entire time. Not because the mission turned out to be deadly. There was one guard Ciabatta dispatched of. But rather, trying to triangulate what the heck is actually going on had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.\n\n* What does Ciabatta really want here? The priest is already captured.\n* Why did he ask for help from Candia at all? Ruby and Jet (and certainly Lapin) literally did nothing he couldn't have.\n* What was this priest's game with all her blackmail? Was she working alone? Was she working _with_ the church or _against_ it? And if against it, than with who if not her own nation (or at least it's biggest senator)?\n* *_Why are you letting Ciabatta take bag loads of black mail to do.... something that's non-specific?_*\n\nAnd yet... all Ruby and Jet say at the end (because I imagine they're focusing on their characters) is \"wow, he was so cool!\" Uh huh. And then he magically gets \"mistakenly\" called out as an emperor candidate the next day, eh? \n\nIn some sense, all the characters are allowed to be this naive, perhaps with the exception of Theo and Lapin. Theo may not be politically enough in the know, but has the right level of distrust. I was hoping to see more double-agent'ing from Lapin with the church, but with a battle in the cathedral next episode, that ship might've sailed.\n\nMy point is, they were all so focused on their characters, and on the easy emperor win for Candia, that no one has explored at all what the plans are for the Meatlands, or Veggieland. Breadland,  Dairyland, and the church are clearly in the game right now, but it's still so very early... assuming the PC's wise up to the game they've been dropped into at all.\n\n## In Sum\n\nI'm having a blast this season because it's basically Game of Thrones, the good parts, except easier to tell everyone apart because they're literal food groups instead of all different white guys with beards.\n\nI suspect Brennan might have his first PC death this season if things continue at this rate. \n\nI'll be watching, and so should you!","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nSo I've been watching [Dimension 20's A Crown of Candy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOnnqKPh5RY) on [Dropout](https://www.dropout.tv/).

It didn't help me understand what to do next.\n\nMaybe because I'm used to sports and weight lifting, the way bluesharmonica.com phrased it really resonated with me: you've just got to put in the reps. It'll suck, but do it 100 times and it'll get better.\n\nIt reminds me of an old Aikido saying: the way to learn to roll [on the ground] is to roll a thousand times. Then you'll know how to roll. Same with bending.\n\nFocusing on reps let me bite-size any action, and just hit repeat over and over until it starting feeling better (or my mouth got tired) while being confident this is what practice should probably look like. Bend a note. Then bend it 10 times. Then bend it up from the blow and then down from the draw and back again. Bend it smoothly and bend it with a quick snap to the tone. \n\nBreak it down and conquer it a piece at a time, rather than just pulling in your breath funky for a few minutes and giving up.\n\n## A Thinking Framework that Helped Me\n\n**Caveat**: this could be a terrible idea but it seems to have helped me with my minor breakthrough, so I'll share it for others.\n\nI find a lot of the information on bending focuses on tongue position and placement. When I focused on this, I found that the advice didn't really connect, and I wasn't getting the bend I was looking for either.\n\nWhat _did_ start to work well, was focusing on drawing the air to a particular point on my hard palette (or behind it). Then I found in making that happen my tongue would end up the right shape more often than not.\n\nHopefully that's not terrible advice for newbies, because it seemed to help me.\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nI can tell now the next challenge is... my bends are just terrible to listen to. I don't like how they sound, and I kind of can't imagine lying to anyone and calling them \"music.\"\n\nI'm reminded of the amazement I always had watching trombone and violin players find notes seemingly out of nowhere. I never took up those instruments precisely because I thought it would be too hard.\n\n... But the only way to get good is to put in the reps. I am committed for _at least_ a month. So let's see how we fare at the end of it... even if I'm currently dreaming of switching to chromatic harp or trying ocarina instead where I can run from this scary thing I've just started to learn.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nThough I have attempted to learn harmonica a handful of times in my life, I've always given up when it was time to learn bending.

My study song of choice is [Rainbow Connection](https://www.harptabs.com/song.php?ID=699), which I've leaned into way more than the lessons. I'm focused on trying to get clear, single notes and get a little bit of feeling into it. It's been really fun.\n\nI think I need a clearer picture of which mechanics lessons to do each day. I haven't figured out a great way to do the bluesharmonica.com lessons in my car. The phone is fine, and I've printed the sheet music, but it's a little clunky to try and tie it all together. I figured I wouldn't worry too much about it for the first week.\n\nI should probably start recording myself to get a sense of how I sound over time. I should also lean more into formal lessons and using the metronome. I already sense the bending will be a challenge for me (which is where I've stopped in the past), but let's nail all the basics on straight harp first.\n\nI also originally was learning on a C harmonica, but since the lessons were mostly with an A harmonica, I grabbed one of those two and like it a lot better.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nI'm aware that it's dangerous writing too much about stuff that's in progress, but I'm hoping keeping a weekly-ish account of my thoughts will be more instructive than not.\n\nI'm learning the harmonica, in case the title wasn't obvious.\n<!--more-->\nI'm trying to model this a bit as an [Ultralearning project a la Scott Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/).
